// About:
// I decided to make C++ the second project language file for this project (seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_UltiMaker_Cura) as C++ is the main language Cura is written in, and this project is purely about the Cura software, so it fits. G-Code came first, as it is more commonly used. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
