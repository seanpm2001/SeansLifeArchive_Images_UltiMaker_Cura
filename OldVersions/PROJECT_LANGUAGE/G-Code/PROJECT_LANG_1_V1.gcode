(Project language file 1)
(For: seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_UltiMaker_Cura/)
(About:)
(I decided to make G-CODE the first and main project language file for this project (seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_UltiMaker_Cura) as STL files are binary, and G-CODE is not. Cura is written mostly in C++ and Python, but I don't want to use those languages as the first project language file here (they can be second and third) G-Code is more commonly used. It is getting itd own project language file, starting here. )

(Header end.)
THIS IS NOT A VALID G-CODE FILE. PLEASE DO NOT RUN IT AND EXPECT FUNCTIONALITY. I hope that this line outside the header just prints output to the console of the program it was opened in.
